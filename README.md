### Hi there 👋

- :computer: I'm currently studying Software Engineering at Uni
- 🌱 The langues/technologies I'm fluent or fluent-enough in (in no particular order): C++, C#, Java (SpringBoot, Swing, TestNG, JUnit), Python, PHP, Go, SQL, JavaScript, WebDesign (HTML+CSS/SCSS/SASS), Angular + TypeScript, Android Dev (Java + AS), Selenium testing
- 🗣️ Human tongues I speak include English and Serbian (native)
- :pencil2: Drawing and Design are also something I enjoy doing and improving in
- 📚 Reading is another passion of mine - engineering books, world classics, fantasies... you name it
- Quote I like atm: *There are many things I don't do, but there are none I can't do.*
